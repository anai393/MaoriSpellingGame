24/09/21
- Learned how to use scenebuilder today, played around with topic button layout
- Implemented buttons to insert vowels with macrons into text field, for some reason these buttons caused gui to freeze when the text was written from scenebuilder but if done through fxml file it was fine
- fixed speed settings, i didn't realise that the order of the code would matter so much, duration stretch has to be immediately before say text or it doesn't work
